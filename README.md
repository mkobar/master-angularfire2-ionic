# Master AngularFire2 for Ionic Apps

The DebtTracker app is the showcased app in the book: **Master AngularFire2 for
Ionic Framework** which covers:

* User Authentication.
* CRUD.
* Transactions.
* Firebase Storage.
* Firebase Security Rules.
* ...and more.

## Installation

Clone this repository using ssh:

$ git clone git@github.com:javebratt/master-angularfire2-ionic.git
```

Or https:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/javebratt/master-angularfire2-ionic.git
```

Once cloned, move into the app folder and edit the name of the file
`app/credentials.backup.ts` to be simply `app/credentials.ts`.
